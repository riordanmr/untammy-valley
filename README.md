# untammy-valley 

Untammy Valley is an iOS game that traces the adventures of a family member who works at
Cramer's Little Valley bar.  

A global disaster is pending, and only you can prevent calamity. To save the world,
you must build a huge snowmobile and travel to China. This requires a lot of resources,
so first you must work at the bar to earn money - all while going to high school
and getting good grades.
